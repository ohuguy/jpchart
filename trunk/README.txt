JPChart allows you to plot price information (like the stock price of a company) together with indicators, volume and such.

The project has the following main goals:

    * Fast and intuitive for end users
    * Easy to implement and extend for developers
    * Feature rich and comprehensive

How to compile:

No external sources are needed to compile this project. Just import all the code under the src folder into your IDE, compile it, and run the runnable class org.jpchart.text.TestPlot1 without any arguments.
